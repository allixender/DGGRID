DGGRID Unix Make Instructions
=============================

These instructions assume you are on a Unix/Linux system.

**1. Go into the DGGRID source directory, DGGRID/src.

**2. Some basic Make settings are given in the text file
src/MakeIncludes.noCMake, and are used by the Makefiles in the
sub-directories. Edit this file if you want to add or remove build flags.

In particular, the variable BUILD_WITH_GDAL indicates whether or not
DGGRID should be built with the GDAL library (the default is TRUE). If
building with GDAL you must set GDAL_HDR_LIB to the location of the gdal
header files and GDAL_LIB to the gdal library file you want to link to
DGGRID.

**3. Build DGGRID by executing:

   make -f Makefile.noCMake

**4. If/when the make is successful there will be a command line
executable file "dggrid" in the directory DGGRID/src/apps/dggrid.
This is the DGGRID program. Assuming dggrid is in your command search
path you may execute it with:

dggrid someMetaFileName.meta

See the DGGRID documentation and examples for details of metafile contents.

**5. The directory DGGRID/examples contains a set of example DGGRID runs
with pre-computed output. You can run these examples and automatically compare
your output to the pre-computed output by going into DGGRID/examples and
executing:

   ./doexamples

See the manual for more details on the parameters contained in the example
metafiles.

Note that some of the examples use GDAL; if you build DGGRID without GDAL
those examples will fail to run successfully for you.

**6. If you have doxygen installed you can build the source code documentation
by going into DGGRID/src and executing:

   doxygen

This will create a directory DGGRID/src/docs containing the generated
source code documentation in pdf and html formats.

Note: Step 3 also builds the sample application DGGRID/src/apps/appex/appex,
which is intended as a simple demonstration of using calls to the dglib
library to manipulate DGG cells in source code.
